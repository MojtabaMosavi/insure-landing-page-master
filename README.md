## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascriot 
- BEM
- Sass

### What I learned

1. That the behavior of z-index property is dependent on the positioning of the element and if specific styles such as trasnform are applied to the element.
2. How to use pictur tag to create responsive images.
3. Usage of object-fit property which is used to corp images.
4. A basic understanding of how and when to use css animation, For example I learned that css animation should be avoided on the mobile screen if possible because
   it hurts the performance of a site and uses a huge amount of bandwidth.    
5 How to write much more modular and organized styles using the @use, @forward and 7-1 architecture pattern.
6. How to write more accessible markup throught the usage of aria-label and aria-hidden attributes.
7. Creating accessible icons.

### Continued development

1. Minimizing the styles.
2. Improving the usage of BEM
